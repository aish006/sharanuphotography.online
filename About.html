		<p>My carrer started in 2003 since from last 20 years where i learned on how to create epic, adventurous and sometimes off grids of photos events. I take a great pride in the relationships i build with not only to my vendors i work with but the people who trust me on thier special day to make it more special and memoriable. I've been shooting from last 20 years all around of several locations with increadble experience. </p>

		<p>To tell more about me photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever. It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything and When I have a camera in my hand, I know no fear. A whole new world has opened to me from 2003 : DSLR Camera,lenses,tripods,picture editing programs, filters, composition and light. My photos ia always impresedd I usually receive positive feedback.</p>

		<p>The another new skills i learnt to designing , video editing  etc which in turn made me more powerful with these skills.On the whole I'm naturally quite proud that I have made progress, but the success is definately due to the fact that I did'nt give up.On the other hand I think that constructive feedback wouldn't be bad either, because it would help me to understand my mistakes and to improve them.To conclud, I'm hoping that i get more and more collections of good pictures exists with me and improve , learn more skills.</p>
